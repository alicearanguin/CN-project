<h1> Improving Productivity with IT</h1>

<p>  Learning has always been my passion, and I'm always up for something new.I have come from Southeast Asia.I came to UK about 10 years ago.I love to travel and document each experience.I have travelled to 25 countries and met a lot of people from different background.
        I have done a vocational course for Business and Management and I have also done  TEFL (Teaching English as Foreign Language) course.
        I am currently working as a Personal Assistant. My job involves a lot of planning,organising and multi-tasking.
        As far as the job is concerned,I am absolutely enjoying what I do, but I know there is always room for improvement.
        I have always been fascinated wih people who are good with technology.I always wanted to learn more about the IT business.
        Few months ago,I have been researching on what I can do to improve my knowledge about technology .I went to search online and looked for short courses for IT and coding.    I stumbled upon Code Nation and have read reviews and they were all positive.I have told my employer regarding the course ,and he agreed and was happy to fund for it.
        I have opted for the Develop coding course. On the first week of the course,I have already learned a lot.
        We have started with Python ,learned about the Dot notation,variables and different functions.
        It seemed complex at first,but our tutor has been very helpful and thorough and made everything easier for us to understand.
        We have been divided into groups and we did our first project which was "text based game".
        Here we were able to apply everything we have learned on the first week and it has been a successful one for us so far.

<h3>1.1 Purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
    
    <p> IT has become an eternal fashion in modern business.It drives innovation and innovation is the path to business success. Innovation in business has the same impact that steam had on the industrial revolution. IT also plays a major role in modern education.Various ideas are given by these technologies.In olden days,education was only a study in Hand books,but now,it is more advanced and practical.
    Businesses utilize IT in a number of different contexts and for many different purposes.When most people think IT, they think of computers: desktop machines, laptops and mobile devices used by individuals to input and manipulate data, create digital documents, conduct research, and more.IT includes the applications and executable programs that are installed on these devices to enable the user to complete the task at hand. Somewhat less obviously, IT may also include the costs associated with purchasing, configuring and maintaining the necessary hardware and equipment to keep the company’s IT systems operating smoothly. In these ways, IT has become critical to the global business community.

     <h3>1.2 How make a digital project successful?</h3>
     <p>These are the tools you can use when embarking on a digital project:
        <ul>
    <li> Trello board- to organise tasks and manage lists of things and will give you a visual overview of what is being worked on and who is working on it.</li>
    <li>Google  - for research,finding websites and referencing.
    <li>Slack - a great tool especially for group projects,it enables you to create a channel for a team project and allows you to share information,files and more all in one place.</li>
    <li>HTML/CSS are the two core technologies needed to build Web pages.HTML is used to create the actual content of the page,whilst CSS is responsible for the design or style of the website,including the layout,visual effects and background colour.</li>
    
    </ul>
    One  must consider the goals of the project,copyright issues,financial resources and the intended audience. 
    
    </p>
    
    
    
    <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT </h3>
    
    <p>In planning tasks using IT,you need to break big tasks  into smaller pieces,focus on one task at a time.Trello board would be very helpful to organise tasks and list of jobs.There are also few points to consider in using IT,you need to prioritise what is the required purpose in creating the digital project and what is the main objective.
    </p>
    
    
    
    <h3>1.4  Risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail?</h3>
    
    <p>Digital projects fail because of lack of strategy,poor management and wrong platform for the purpose.Some projects aren't within the financial budget and don't have enough resources.In doing digital projects , deadline has to be met and frequent changes are made for project specifications along the way ,and resulting to a project being inadequate and poorly designed and  would be essentially unusuable.</p>
    
    <h3>1.5 Selecting and using IT systems and software </h3>
    
    
    <p>In selecting IT systems ,the first thing you should do ,is to understand the project's main objective.
        You need to know who your audience would be.It also depends on who you are working for i.e working for yourself, or a client.You have to determine whether you actually need a front end, back end and database.</p>
    
    
    
<h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your
            chosen technologies have helped you achieve
            your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan
            and how can git and GitHub help with your codes
            version control
            </h3>
    <p>Trello has helped me process everything successfully within the time frame.It provides a straightforward system for organizing and monitoring my project.</p>
    
    <h4>Benefits of having version control:</h4>
    
    <p>Having a GitHub repo makes it easy for you to keep track of collaborative and personal projects - all files necessary for certain analyses can be held together and people can add in their code, graphs, etc. as the projects develop. Each file on GitHub has a history, making it easy to explore the changes that occurred to it at different time points. You can review other people’s code, add comments to certain lines or the overall document, and suggest changes. For collaborative projects, GitHub allows you to assign tasks to different users, making it clear who is responsible for which part of the analysis. You can also ask certain users to review your code. For personal projects, version control allows you to keep track of your work and easily navigate among the many versions of the files you create, whilst also maintaining an online backup. </p>

<h3>1.7 Legal guidelines and constraints that
            impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact
            digital projects?</h3>
    
    <p>  GDPR regulates how companies store data,there are a number of laws for digital businesses. You need to keep abreast of changes to ensure that you are complying with the various rules.
            One of the primary objectives of GDPR is adjusting the legal regulations concerning the processing and protection of personal data to better fit the challenges of technological development and globalization which have facilitated the unprecedented availability and pervasive use of personal data. Just to be clear, by personal data I mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person—including identifiers such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or, for example, factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,mental,economic,cultural or social identity of that natural person.

    <h4>HTML and CSS: </h4>
    
    <p>HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images.
        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of content—using, for example, fonts or colors.
        The two languages—HTML and CSS—are independent of one another and should remain that way. CSS should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa. As a rule, HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance of that content.

<h1>Unit 2: Outcome 1</h1>
    
    
<h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h3>
    <p>In writing my content, I have done a lot of research.I have made it simple and accesible for the audience to read.I have provided links and references .</p>
    
    
    
    
<h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>
    
    <p>Copyright affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish.  The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.</p>
      
    <h4>There are other laws or constraints that also affect the content of websites:</h4>
    
    <p>National security laws -It is important to ensure that any data on your webiste - such as customer's personally identifiable or financial information is not exposed to cybercriminals or the website is not exploited in any other way.
         Pornography laws - Different standards by nation.</p>
    
    
     <h3>1.6  Issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h3>   
     
     <p>There are barriers for people with disabilities using webpages.Accessibility is necessary and can be added to web functionality by means of tools,additional software or even special training.Having a disability might be an obstacle,but there are still plenty of ways to navigate the web.</p>
    
     <h4>Blindness </h4> <p>Makes it impossible to view a standard screen display or printed output.A person who is blind often will use a speech output system (e.g., screen reader) to read aloud text that is presented on the screen; this system may be composed of screen reading software and a voice synthesizer.Braille-keyboards is also great tool to help the visually impaired get the most of their web usage.</p>
    <h4>Physical disabilities </h4><p>Impacting mobility may be orthopedic or neuromuscular such as carpal tunnel, various forms of arthritis, cerebral palsy, stroke, muscular dystrophy, arthritis amputation or spinal cord injury. People with physical disabilities may have difficulty using a keyboard, or find it difficult or impossible to use a mouse, and will need to rely on the keyboard for Web browsing. Some people will use adaptive technology with their computer to access the Web. Less severe disabilities could make the task of highlighting, manipulating pull-down boxes or mouse clicks difficult.</p>

    <h4>Difficulty Hearing</h4><p>For those who can still hear but have some difficulty perceiving sounds, there are website modifications that amplify foreground noises and separate them from background sounds.Other ways users can experience the web while having a hearing condition is to find transcripts of the video or auditory content or choose media players that provided captioning.</p>
    
    
    
    <h3>1.7 Appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
    <ul>
    <h4>There are as many different file formats as there are different programs to process the files. A few of the more common file formats are:</h4>
    
    <li>Word documents (.doc) -any document that you create in Microsoft Word, or any of the compatible applications that can save and edit Word files. The default file format of Word documents is DOCX, although you may still encounter the older DOC file format.</li>
    <li>Web text pages (.htm or .html)-  a document commonly written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) that is accessible through the Internet or other networks using an Internet browser. A web page is accessed by entering a URL address and may contain text, graphics, and hyperlinks to other web pages and files.</li>
    <li>Web page images (.gif and .jpg) The most common types of image files online are GIF, JPG, and PNG. All browsers can display them, and web designers use the format that's best for their particular applications.</li>
    <li>Adobe Postcript files (.ps) is an instruction set that tells the printer what to print and   how to print.</li>
    <li>Adobe Acrobat files (.pdf)  Acrobat can be used to create PDF files from other formats, edit them in various ways, add form fields, security settings, etc.</li>
    <li>Executable programs (.exe) An executable is a file that contains a program - that is, a particular kind of file that is capable of being executed or run as a program in the computer. In a Disk Operating System or Windows operating system, an executable file usually has a file name extension of . bat, .com, or .exe.</li>
    <li>Multimedia files (.mp3 and others)  (1) A file that is capable of holding two or more multimedia elements (text, images, audio, video and animations). See multimedia, multimedia container and metafile. (2) Any file other than one containing only text.</li>
    </ul>
